    <p>Working on a few things at the moment. I have to have more than one thing to work on or else I can get bored very quickly. Luckily, everyhitng I am working on right now is big and it has my full attention. I have my GitHub linked on this page if you want to check it out. As far as full updates go, they will be on here as soon as i have this Website a little cleaner!</p>
